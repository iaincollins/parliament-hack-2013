                The aim is to open up new bills for public review and critique.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to increase public engagement and to make identifying meaningful
                feedback easier allowing line by line annotation, comments and voting on draft legislation.
            </p>
            <p>
                By automatically referencing related legislation, discussions in Hansard
                and other bills it should make researching and critiquing a bill easier,
                potentially also making it a useful tool for MPs.
